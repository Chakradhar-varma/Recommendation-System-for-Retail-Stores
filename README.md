# Movie Recommendation System in Python

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Python and Scikit-learn. It processes user-movie rating data and applies recommendation algorithms to suggest movies to users.

## Dataset
The system uses two datasets:
1. **ratings.csv** - Contains user ratings for movies.
2. **movies.csv** - Contains metadata about movies.

## Features
- Loads and processes user-movie rating data.
- Computes movie popularity and user preferences.
- Implements a recommendation algorithm (likely collaborative filtering or content-based filtering).
- Visualizes key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Recommendation_System_in_Python.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Run the notebook step by step to load datasets, process data, and generate recommendations.
- Modify the dataset path if necessary.
